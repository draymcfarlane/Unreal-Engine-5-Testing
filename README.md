# Urban Rush
1. Game Title and Overview

Title: Urban Rush 
Genre: Endless Runner
Target Audience: Casual gamers of all ages
Platform: Windows PC

Game Description:
In Urban Rush, the character the player controls runs across the noisily crowded urban 
environment, dodging moving vehicles and construction barriers while collecting coins and 
catching power-ups such as jump boosts and coin magnets. While the runner speeds up and 
increases the difficulty of gamed play, testing player stamina and quick reflexes, intuitive controls 
and intelligent movement mechanics make the gameplay vivid and rewarding.

2. Game Concept and Core Mechanics
• Game Concept: Navigate a busy cityscape to achieve the maximum possible distance by 
avoiding obstacles and collecting coins.
• Core Goals:
• Survive as long as possible.
• Travel the furthest distance.
• Gather coins to unlock character skins.
• Engagement: Difficulty scales with the runner's speed and smart movement mechanics, 
making the gameplay both challenging and rewarding.
• Core Mechanics:
• Player Actions: Jumping, strafing left/right, sliding, and gathering coins.
• Game Rules: The game ends if the player hits an obstacle or falls into an 
untraversable gap.
• Controls:
• W: Jump
• A: Move Left
• S: Slide/Move Down Faster
• D: Move Right
• Smart Movement: Players can chain moves; for example, pressing jump 
and then slide twice makes the character automatically slide upon landing, 
and pressing jump while sliding will make the character jump immediately 
after sliding.
• Game Loop: The player automatically starts running through the city, dodging obstacles, 
collecting coins, and using power-ups. As the game progresses, the speed of the runner 
increases, requiring quicker reactions and precision.


3. Story and Setting
• 
Storyboard:
Urban Rush places players in the role of a runner navigating a vibrant urban environment 
filled with challenges. The runner must weave through traffic, avoid construction barriers, 
and collect coins scattered along the way. Power-ups provide temporary advantages to help 
the player traverse the increasing difficulty of the city streets.
• 
Main Character: A customizable runner with unlockable skins that players can 
purchase using collected coins.
• 
Challenges: Avoiding vehicles that are sometimes moving or stationary, 
construction barriers, and other city-specific obstacles while keeping up with the 
increasing speed of the game.
• World of Game: A dynamic, bustling urban environment featuring cartoonish cityscapes 
with randomized 1 to 3 floored buildings, intersections leading to tunneled roads (aesthetic 
only), and busy sidewalks filled with objects to add more depth and remove flatness of the 
environment to the sides of the map.
4. Art Style and Aesthetic
• 
Visual Style:
• 
Clean, cartoonish 3D art style with vibrant colors and dynamic animations that 
highlight the city’s liveliness.
• 
A visually engaging aesthetic without overwhelming players.
• 
Character Design:
• 
The main character starts as a default runner in ragged attire.
• 
Players can unlock and purchase new themed skins, such as a knight, casual city-
goer, or female fighter, using in-game coins.
• 
Environmental Design:
• 
Cartoonish cityscape with a busy sidewalk filled with objects to add more depth to 
the sides of the map, different style buildings with randomized heights, and 
intersections leading to tunneled roads on the sides.
5. Sound and Music
• 
Sound Effects: Cartoonish sounds for jumping, sliding, collecting coins, and hitting 
obstacles (e.g., musical symbols to indicate the player had hit an object).
• 
Music:
• 
Normal calm electronic music looping in the menu.
• 
Upbeat looping tracks intensify as the character starts running.
• 
Game-over music signifies the end of the run.
• 
Voice Acting: Not included, as the game focuses on reflex-based gameplay rather than 
storytelling.

• 
Tools and Software: FAB marketplace for models and assets, Figma for some texture 
design, Audacity for sound editing, Unreal Engine’s animation and scripting tools.
• 
Programming Languages: Mainly Blueprinting with integral C++ assistance for Unreal 
classes etc.
• 
Platform Requirements:
• 
PC: Windows 10/11 supporting lower to high-end PCs or laptops. A mid-range GPU 
recommended for smooth gameplay.
7. Development Timeline
